This document provides steps to replicate the results from the report.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Setup Environment:**
   - Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed.
   - Install required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

2. **Prepare Dataset:**
   - Download the bug report dataset (e.g., `tensorflow.csv`).
   - Place it in the root directory of the repository.

3. **Run Notebooks:**
   - Open `NB+SVM_+XG+DistilBERT.ipynb` to run classical models.
   - Open `Bug_Report_Classification_Bert.ipynb` to run DistilBERT.
   - Ensure the notebook kernel has sufficient RAM (>8GB) for BERT.

4. **Collect Results:**
   - After execution, results will be printed and saved to CSV files.
   - Confusion matrices and classification reports will be displayed.

5. **Compare Performance:**
   - Compare metrics like F1 Score and AUC with the baseline (Naive Bayes + TF-IDF).

You should be able to reproduce the experimental setup and results with minimal deviation.
